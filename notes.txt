SCRUM:
3 roles
3 artifacts
5 events

Requirements are fairly clear
How decisionmakers will behave.
Well understood technology.

Waterfall experience.

Agile: Hardware development.
Join kanban and scrum. 

Methodology as a tool to get to vision.
What does it mean if we drop X? What are the consequences for the project?
Try full book for 4-6 weeks (3 sprints). Then see problems. 

Theory X vs Theory Y: Kick people to get them to work vs provide them an environment to do work they want to do
The tool alone doesn't solve your problem



Coaching: I don't tell you anything, I just ask questions
Mentoring: I can tell you what worked in my experience
Consulting: You know best, you say how it's done

Management: Assignment of work packages
Leadership: Turn this ship around. Grow your people. 
With the knowledge I have given you, how can you apply this to your situation?
Never about yourself, instead about helping people develop. 
Don't do things to make you shine, make it so you can step aside and the ship will run without you.

How people deal with problems:
How they deal with involving the consultants
Are people allowed to speak on the same level. 
Is the manager the main person talking.
Who does the presenting?


It's your job to work as hard as you can so that your people can replace you.





And who are you, the proud lord said
that I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat
that's all the truth I know.
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
a lion still has claws

And mine are long and sharp, my lord
as long and sharp as yours.
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
that lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
with no one there to hear.

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall
with not a soul to hear.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke
that lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
with no one there to hear.
Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall
with not a soul to hear.

And who are you.
